# E-COMMERCE

#### The e-commerce-app is a fully online and modern e commerce store concept. It is implemented with a simple login in system, allows users to add products to their cart, confirm a transaction to buy the products in their cart, add comments on the products, and even sell their own items on the store! (CRUD operations)

### The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to: 
> - HTML/CSS/JavaScript
> - MERN stack
> - Front-end
> - Back-end
> - Building a REST API
> - Web Architectural Patterns

#### More specifically, I used the following:
> - Dependency injection
> - Client Server architecture pattern
> - Service Oriented architecture pattern
> - 3 tier architecture (presentation/business/data access layers)
> - Testing API Endpoints (Postman)
> - HTTP (GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH, status codes)
> - RESTful API guidelines

# Front-end
Stored in the client folder. Use the following commands to start the front-end on port 3000 :
> - 'cd .\client\'
> - 'npm install'
> - 'npm start'
# Back-end
Stored in the server folder. Use the following commands in a second terminal to start the back-end on port 5000 :
> - 'cd .\server\'
> - 'npm install'
> - 'npm start'
#### A connection to the mongoDB database is automatically put in place after having ran the back-end.
