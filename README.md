# e-commerce-app
Project is composed of a react front-end and an express back-end communication with a mongoDB server.
# Front-end
It is stored in the client folder. Use 'cd .\client\' to navigate to the folder. Then use 'npm install' to install the dependencies. Then use 'npm start' to start the front-end on port 3000.
# Back-end
It is stored in the server folder. In a second terminal, use 'cd .\server\' to navigate to the folder. Then use 'npm install' to install the dependencies. Then use 'npm start' to start the back-end on port 5000. A connection to the mongoDB database is automatically put in place after having ran the back-end.
